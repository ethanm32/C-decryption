Program Description: 
    
This program is a security program that takes in a code(randomly generated or manually entered).
The code entered/randomly generated will be encrypted using a provided encryption algorithm when option 2 is chosen.
This will be compared to a default code - 4523 when the user chooses option 3 in the menu.If the user chooses option 4 
the code will be decrypted.The 5th option displays how many times the code has been entered/generated correctly/incorrectly
and finally the 6th option will exit the program if the user chooses the y(yes) option and will continue if the user chooses the n(no) 
option.
